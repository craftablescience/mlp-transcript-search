# MLP Transcript Search

A short Python program to find a spoken phrase in MLP:FiM. Searches every episode of every season.
The transcripts it uses were created by Alan J. Back ([ajback@yahoo.com](mailto:ajback@yahoo.com)),
I downloaded them from [this master Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QD7zg-nTkYkRl1zHp7ZpJ2FJXQM0bzguGvWZK83RzSM/edit).

Specials are not included, but if you'd like to search them as well, download the
transcripts from the linked doc and put them in the `transcripts` folder.

Example output (uncolored, because I can't add ANSI color codes to this preview):
